                <p class="lorem">My name is Dillon Pittman and welcome to my portfolio! I'm a native Austinite at least two generations back on both sides of my family. I'm a hard worker in the Pittman tradition. I worked with my father during the summers starting when I was in middle school as a handyman. I learned a ton from working with him for seven years after high school.</p>

                <p class="lorem">I got tired of working with my father for that long and decided to find something new. I've skipped around to several jobs since then and never settled on anything. I tried classes at Austin Community College for a bit, studying electrical engineering, but it never really caught my interest so I kept working whatever jobs did seem interesting. That was fine for my twenties but now I'm rounding the corner of thirty and I need to push my way to a career.</p>
